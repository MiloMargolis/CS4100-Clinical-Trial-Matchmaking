The purpose of this project is to improve the process of matching patients to clinical trials but using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and predictive modeling. Our tool helps potential patients (or even their clinitians) find the most relevant clinical trials based on their medical profiles. This simplifies the clinical trial search process and improves efficiency for enrolled patients. 

## Overview 
Modern day clinical trials often suffer from mismatches and recruitment issues which results in slower medical advancements. The system we have created aims to:
- Parse clinical trial data from [ClinicalTrails.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
- Take in patient profiles (for example, sex, age, disease, etc.) as input
- Use NLP techniques to compare patient data with eligibility criteria.
- Rank trails in order based on the best fit
