NCT00923273,Sirolimus and Pemetrexed to Treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",TERMINATED,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

  1. Histologically documented non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology at the Clinical Center/National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Laboratory of Pathology at National Naval Medical Center (NNMC).
  2. Tumor biopsy will be requested from all study subjects unless the procedure poses too great a risk. If the subject declines, he or she may still participate in the study. We will ask subjects not undergoing biopsy to provide 6 unstained slides or a tissue block of archived tissue for immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation. Tumors from subjects enrolling in the phase II portion of the study will be analyzed retrospectively to demonstrate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation as assessed by immunohistochemistry in a fresh biopsy. mTOR activation will be defined using distribution and intensity of staining for phosphorylation of mTOR, or its downstream substrates S6 kinase (S6K), and S6. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing the acquisition and handling of PBMCs and tissues are outlined in appendix 10.3 and 10.4. At a minimum, a total score (sum of intensity and distribution scores) of 2 for phospho-S6 or phospho-mTOR (S2448) mTOR will be required to determine that mTOR is active. Either measurement will be sufficient to ascertain that mTOR is active. Measurement of phosphorylation of Akt, factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and total levels of thymidylate synthase (TS) will also be measured, but are not part of the eligibility requirements. In the event of limited tissue availability, the stains will be prioritized as follows: S6, mTOR, S6K, Akt (S473), Akt (T308), and TS. Phosphorylation of S6 correlates most closely with mTOR activity, while phosphorylation of mTOR at S2448 best predicts response to sirolimus.
  3. Tissue from the time of original diagnosis will be adequate for enrollment on study. Optional fresh tissue biopsy must be obtained AFTER their most recent chemotherapy (including small molecule or targeted therapy) or radiation therapy. Tumors that can be biopsied percutaneously (with or without computed tomography (CT)/ultrasound guidance) or via bronchoscopy will be considered accessible if there are no other competing risk factors such as coagulopathy, hypoxemia, unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled pain, or inability to give informed consent.
  4. Individuals with relapsed NSCLC who have received at least one standard chemotherapeutic regimen are eligible. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and then relapse or recur less than or equal to 12 months after completion of chemotherapy will be eligible. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and relapse greater than 12 months after completion of chemotherapy should receive frontline therapy for metastatic disease before enrollment, as should individuals who initially present with incurable disease that is chemotherapy naive. Individuals unwilling to receive standard front line therapy for metastatic lung cancer may enroll.
  5. Patients must have not received any chemotherapy, biological, or radiation therapy in the 21 days prior to protocol enrollment. All previous chemo and radiation therapy induced toxicities must have resolved to grade 1 or less prior to enrollment.
  6. Because sirolimus may affect the efficacy of hormonal birth control via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4), study subjects of child bearing potential must be willing to use barrier birth control while receiving sirolimus therapy and for 12 weeks after discontinuation of sirolimus.
  7. Patients must have measurable disease for the phase II portion of the study.
  8. Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

The effects of brigatinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MD Anderson Institutional Policy # CLN1114). This includes all female patients, between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following:

Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

   10. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy), who:
