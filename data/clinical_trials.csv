Alternatively, direct volumetric measurements via slice by slice contouring on a treatment planning software package can be used to calculate the total tumor volume.
  * Brain metastases can be diagnosed synchronous to the initial diagnosis of small cell lung cancer or metachronous to the initial diagnosis and management of small cell lung cancer.
  * Brain metastases must be diagnosed on MRI, which will include the following elements:

    * REQUIRED MRI ELEMENTS

      * Post gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient (SPGR). Acceptable 3D SPGR sequences include magnetization prepared 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE), turbo field echo (TFE) MRI, BRAVO (Brain Volume Imaging) or 3D Fast FE (field echo).

* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) as a DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib); these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment, then she was considered not of child bearing potential.
32. Fertile males not willing to use contraception. Fertile males must use condom with spermicide. Highly effective contraception, as defined above, was to be used by both sexes (male patients and their female partners) during study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study medication and was not to father a child in this period. A condom was required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.",,,INTERVENTIONAL
